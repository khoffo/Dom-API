# DOM-API-Task

# Task Description
You are tasked to create a website that retrieves data from an API and displays it on a web page.
However, there is a catch: you are only allowed to create one HTML element in your HTML file. This means you must use JavaScript and CSS to manipulate the DOM and create a fully functional website.

You can choose to use either the Dog API or the Star Wars API to fetch data. Your website should display a list of items retrieved from the API (e.g. a list of dog breeds or a list of Star Wars characters) along with their associated details.

Here are the specific requirements for your website:

## HTML
You are only allowed to create one HTML element in your HTML file. This element can be any HTML element, such as a div or a section,. The rest of the website must be created using JavaScript and CSS.

## CSS
You must use CSS to style your website. The styling should be consistent across all pages and should follow best practices for web design.

## JavaScript
You must use JavaScript to retrieve data from the API and create the content for your website. Your JavaScript code should be modular and follow best practices for JavaScript programming.

## Functionality
Your website should have the following functionality:

Retrieve data from the API using fetch() or a similar method.
Display a list of items retrieved from the API (e.g. a list of dog breeds or a list of Star Wars characters) along with their associated details.
Allow the user to click on an item to display more details about that item (e.g. a picture of the dog breed or a summary of the character's backstory).

## API's
You can select from any of these two api's.
##### Dog API - https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
##### Star Wars API - https://swapi.dev/

## Submission
You should submit your code in a GitHub repository. Your repository should include:

An index.html file with the one HTML element that you are allowed to create.
A styles.css file with the CSS styling for your website.
One or more JavaScript files with the code for your website.
Add a README.md file that describes your website and how to run it.
You should submit on GitHub classroom as well as on the LMS
You are to submit the hosted link on the LMS
The task should be submitted on or before 12 noon on Tuesday (9th of May, 2023)

##  Bonus Points
You can earn bonus points for the following:

Adding more functionality to your website, such as a search bar or pagination.
Allow the user to filter the list of items by a specific attribute (e.g. breed or character name).
Allow the user to sort the list of items by a specific attribute (e.g. alphabetically by breed or by birth year for Star Wars characters).
Using a CSS framework such as Bootstrap to style your website.
Adding your own personal touches to the website, such as custom animations or unique styling.
